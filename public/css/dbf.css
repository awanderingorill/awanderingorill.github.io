Hello guys. I am insanely thankful for the time I got to spend with all of you. As the time between visits and phone calls gets longer and longer I realize how great we had it back in the goold old baltimore days. It kind of fills me with regret and self-loathing (which is a response I am trying to stop having when I realize later what I could have done better) that I didn’t realize how great it was and that I didn’t give each of you my best. I don’t know if best is the right word. I guess its more that realize how many layers I keep between me and the people around me, I wish I realized how far I was keeping you and how much we were missing because of it. Layers of shame, layers of perceived slights, of made up norms and standards, and all those things. Undoubtedly at times over the years you saw through them—that is what I am really thankful for because in those moments our friendships were forged and we learned from each other—but that is also where my regret comes in because I kept you away. It makes me realize how important it is for me to communicate with my friends. (Wow this has taken an unplanned turn—oh well).
I really love you all, each of you rubbed off on me, changed me, and I love the little bits of me that are you. Just fuck agh thank god I met you. Jeremey Will Ana Kristine Hannah Sylvie (ordered in time since I last saw you) I have so much in common with each of you, and, even more, I have learned so much from you. Thank you. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for your patience, forgiveness, and kindness in the rough times. Thank you for your support and motivation all the time. I am lucky. Beyond lucky.
I bring each of you with me everywhere I go. We are all starting over yet again. I guess we are constantly starting over. I am not going to worry anymore. My worrying is what makes me scared and when I am scared I hide and when I hide I don’t get to be the real Drummond for myself and for the world to experience. I have got the love of good people and if I get hurt I get hurt but I am not going to worry about it, so as I make new friends they will meet the good Drummond without having to put up with the endless spliffs, the boisterousness, the anger. I have just been thinking a lot about you guys and feel like the crappy stuff I have done should have negated any love, since it hasn’t, since it didn’t I will keep striving to be the best I can and to find the beautiful places in spacetime like our Abell house. I love you all
