      <h2>Journalist, Coder</h2>
      <p>I'm a journalist and a coder with experience in several other mediums. I started my career as a writer and a copyeditor. Then I stumbled upon video production. I pitched, researched, and co-produced a documentary at <em>Vice</em>, and then helped launch the New York bureau of Al Jazeera's <em>Fault Lines</em>. I'm currently enrolled in a three-month, full-time course in full-stack web development.</p>

      <h2>Life After Guantánamo</h2>
      <p>
        This film, mostly set in Yemen, centers around three former Guantánamo detainees and their lives after their time in the prison. I read through piles of DoD memos and put together profiles of ten detainees in preparation for the weeklong shoot. I also found Donald Rumsfeld's summer home address. We doorstepped him. He wasn't pleased.

      <h2>Medellín Fashion Week</h2>
      <p>
        This 45-minute documentary explores the idea of beauty in Pablo Escobar's former stomping grounds of Medellín, Colombia. I called dozens of plastic surgeons, finally securing one who allowed us to film a live gluteoplasty. I also played the role of interpreter, translating from Spanish to English and vice versa during interviews. I booked all guests and interviewees and took care of production planning.

      <h2>Playgiarize</h2>
      <p>
        For my first project in GA's <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive" target="new" title="GA: Web Development Immersive">Web Development Immersive</a> course, I built a tool for slackers everywhere. <em>Playgiarize</em> takes each word inputted and switches it to a synonym of that word.
      </p>
      <p>
        I won't vouch for the viability of its plagiarized response. Let's just say that this app could benefit quite a bit from a linguistics consultant. Working on that.
