	<p class="title">Limbs</p>
	The Paul Smith spotted sweater,<br>
	The mouth guards.<br>
	
	<p>
		The DivaCup,<br>
		The tampon-slap,<br>
		The NuvaRing,<br>
		The pill.<br>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The Saturday spliff,<br>
		The Seinfeld binge,<br>
		The purple and orange in Utah.<br>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The spoon I threw,<br>
		The cookies I dumped on you,<br>
		Asking “ARE YOU HUNGRY?”<br>
		When you came home stoned.<br>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The bike light I found,<br>
		The shades you saved from Austin, Nevada.<br>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The Felt bikes we rode,<br>
		The milkshakes we ate,<br>
		The churches we defiled,<br>
		The orgasms we had.<br>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The man and his cat standing at the corner of Channing and Milvia.<br>
		The woman fiending on BART whose mom owns that bar in SF.<br>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The Broken Bells,<br>
		The flight to Cartagena,<br>
		The New Year’s rave nap at 289 Kent.<br>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The aguardiente and Benadryl,<br>
		The worn black t-shirt,<br>
		The nook of the chest,<br>
		The kiss on the head.<br>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The face you make<br>
		When you look up<br>
		From licking me.<br>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The Panama City airport.<br>
		The planet of Jupiter.<br>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		A geologist at Bryce Canyon<br>
		Passionately explaining the<br>
		Rock formations called “hoodoos.”<br>
		(Like you, pointing with zeal<br>
		on a night with bright stars.)<br>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The colors maroon<br>
		And dark green.<br>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The poet, Rumi.<br>
		The author, Rushdie.<br>
		The movie, Biutiful.<br>
		The song, “Halo.”<br>
		The word, “massive.”<br>
	</p>
