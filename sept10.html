			Perfect Stranger
		</p>
		Sometimes when I look at you<br>
		And I feel my sluglike self,<br>
		Someone else walks in.<br>
		She’s taller and thinner.<br>
		She has dark hair.<br>
		She chops tomatoes precisely.<br>
		She draws in shades, not lines.<br>
		When you cry so much you laugh,<br>
		When your head hits the wall,<br>
		When you pace and pace and<br>
		Something hard clogs your throat,<br>
		She says the thing<br>
		That settles the dust.

			Babies
		</p>
		<p>
			I just woke up from a dream.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			We lived in a treehouse.<br>
			You were cold.<br>
			You lit some fires in the leaves,<br>
			In the branches, at the base.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			If you thought it was OK,<br>
			It must have been OK.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			When I came back,<br>
			Everything was on fire.<br>
			You were tossing water on it.<br>
			The water hissed and dissolved.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			“Where’s the fire extinguisher?!”<br>
			I shouted.<br>
			(The fire was loud.)<br>
			It was sitting next to you<br>
			And you handed it to me.<br>
			I fiddled with the hatch,<br>
			Searching for the instructions<br>
			On the side of the canister.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I began to spray,<br>
			Erasing the fire in broad strokes.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I sprayed over the leaves at the top,<br>
			And over the crib we kept<br>
			Next to our bed.<br>
			It was a wooden crib.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Out of the flames and heat flooated<br>
			A picture of me in the crib.<br>
			Then: a picture of us curled up<br>
			In it, on our backs, legs in the air.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			“Strange,” I thought,<br>
			“That we’d sleep in the crib<br>
			When our bed was right next to it.”<br>
			I felt ashamed about the first<br>
			Picture: me, alone, grinning through<br>
			The bars like a happy goblin.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			There was no more fire<br>
			That we could see,<br>
			And you began to walk away.<br>
			I followed you.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Then I thought of crackling<br>
			Red embers, hiding<br>
			Under piles of soot.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			My stomach dropped.<br>
			We should have checked.<br>
			We should have stomped around.
		</p>

			The Saturday spliff,<br>
			The Seinfeld binge,<br>
			The purple and orange in Utah.<br>

		<p>
			The spoon I threw,<br>
			The cookies I dumped on you,<br>
			Asking “ARE YOU HUNGRY?”<br>
			When you came home stoned.<br>

		<p>
			The bike light I found,<br>
			The shades you saved from Austin, Nevada.<br>

			The Felt bikes we rode,<br>
			The milkshakes we ate,<br>
			The churches we defiled,<br>
			The orgasms we had.<br>

			A geologist at Bryce Canyon<br>
			Passionately explaining the<br>
			Rock formations called “hoodoos.”<br>
			(Like you, pointing with zeal<br>
			on a night with bright stars.)<br>

			The colors maroon<br>
			And dark green.<br>

			The song, “Halo.”<br>
			The word, “massive.”<br>

			Shoulder-Friend
		</p>
		I talk to you every day.<br><br>
		Walking through my mom’s garden,<br>
		I’ll tell you, “Wow, these butterfly<br>
		Bushes are so <em>beautiful</em>,”<br>
		Pirating your enthusiasm,<br>
		Squinting at the yellow inside<br>
		Their tiny, purple bodies.<br>
